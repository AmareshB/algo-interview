# Problem 1

Alice has an even number of N beads, and each bead has a number from 1 to N painted on it. She would like to make a necklace out of all the beads, with a special requirement: any two beads next to each other on the necklace must sum to a prime number. Alice needs your help to calculate how many ways it is possible to do so.

For example:

N = 4

There are two possible ways to build the necklace. Note that the last bead connects to the first bead.

1 2 3 4
1 4 3 2
Note: The necklace should be unique. For example: 1 2 3 4 is the same as 2 3 4 1 and 3 4 1 2 and 4 1 2 3.

# Problem 2


The problem is as follows: choose a number, reverse its digits and add it to the original. If the sum is not a palindrome (which means, it is not the same number from left to right and right to left), repeat this procedure. eg.

195 (initial number) + 591 (reverse of initial number) = 786

786 + 687 = 1473

1473 + 3741 = 5214

5214 + 4125 = 9339 (palindrome)

In this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after the 4th addition
